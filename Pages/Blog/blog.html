                <h4>12th Sep, 2023</h4>
                <p>I've been learning Hugo and thinking about improving this website by using the fastest static site
                    generator, 'Hugo'! In that case, I can't predict what will happen next on this website. However, it
                    doesn't mean I'm going to stop working on my personal website. <br> Good luck to me XD</p>

                <p>Check out my <u><i>first project / solution</i></u> from The Odin Coding journey. It's a pure HTML
                    website
                    about
                    recipes.</p>

                <p>I will apply Masonry.js, which I just found on the internet - to the project section. Let's see what
                    happens in the next update!</p>

                <p>It's has been heavily raining since the last week. Frequent class suspension. Internet goes on and
                    off,
                    it slows down the
                    process.</p>

                <p>Nothing particular. I tried to fix some layouts to make it more responsive and I'm so bad at it, but
                    I'm still trying to improve it.</p>

                <p>Javascript has joined the website! In addition, I'm using jQuery to make manipulating DOM
                    easier.</p>

                    <li>Sidebar is now reusable as an inner HTML to every pages to significantly reduce hard-coded

                <p class="indented">Actually, I've been trying to follow the front-end roadmap in a site called <a
                        href="https://roadmap.sh/frontend?r=frontend-beginner">roadmap.sh</a> since a couple of weeks
                    ago, and currently learning with Git. After that, I think I'll be focusing on NPM.</p>

                <p>Finally, the internet has come online.</p>
                <p>I decided to change this section to "Posts & Updates" instead of "Blog" since I'm planning to make a

                <p>Still in offline mode. Can't update my progress to GitHub. Delayed commit, in other words.</p>
                <p><strong>GOOD NEWS:</strong> This Blog page just created today, and I wrote the entries happened in
                    the past.</p>
                <p>In this day, everything here is made from <strong>pure</strong> vanilla HTML and CSS. No frameworks.
                    No API. Yet, No Javascript (at least today, and probably will be using in the future).</p>

                <p>Internet Connection Problem. Literally no internet for 24+ hours. I can't upload the second
                    update
                    of this website to the GitHub repository.
                </p>
                <p>Added the "More Information" in the sidebar to provide more information about me. Specifically, my
                    GitHub and LinkedIn(Not yet available). Still under construction.</p>
